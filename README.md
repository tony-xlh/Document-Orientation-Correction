# Document-Orientation-Correction

A web demo of document orientation correction using [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview) and Tesseract-OCR.

There are two ways to correct the orientation:

1. Use the document scanner's built-in orientation correction capability if it has via TWAIN.
2. Use tesseract-ocr to detect the orientation and then rotate the image.

## Demo Video

In the demo video, I first scan a piece of paper with the auto document orientation feature of Panasonic KV-N1058X disabled. Then, I scan it with the feature enabled to see whether the feature works. Finally, I use tesseract to detect which document images are scanned upside-down and rotate them.
